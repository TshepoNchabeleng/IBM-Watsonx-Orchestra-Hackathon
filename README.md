Platform: IBM watsonx Orchestrate

Status: System Integration Complete (UAT Ready)

1. Executive Summary
The goal of this project was to build a seamless, multi-agent ecosystem that automates the transition from an "inventor's raw idea" to a "lawyer-ready patent filing." The system utilizes specialized agents to handle data intake, prior art analysis, design consultation, and legal document generation.
